## General info
These data came from a University Deep Learning challenge, which was hosted in [Codalab](https://codalab.org/). My team developed different algorithms but here I will show you the ones that I personal created, namely: 

* CNN 1D
* CNN 1D + LSTM
* CNN 2D

Moreover, a report can be found [here](https://github.com/F-Lauria/EEG_classification/blob/master/docs/report.pdf). In the report, you can find descritpions of the other models used it as well as a longer discussion about the CNN2D which tourned out to be the best among all the algorithms we tried.

## Code

In [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/F-Lauria/EEG_classification/blob/master/code/EEG_classification.ipynb) you will find all the models previously mentioned.

## Technologies

All the algorithms are written in Python. The hardware of my machine is not powerful so I ran all the models in Google Colab, [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/one-stop-guide-to-google-colab-d67c94d30516) a nice tutorial about how to use it.

## Dependencies 

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* Keras
