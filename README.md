# EEG_classification
In this repository you will see how to solve a Multiclass classificationt task in python. Different DL algorithms will be tried.

## General info
These data came from a University Deep Learning challenge, which was hosted in [Codalab](https://codalab.org/). As previously mentioned we will deal with different DL algorithms, namely:

* CNN 1D
* CNN 1D + LSTM
* CNN 2D

Unfortunately I cannot upload here the data because they are too big, in the notebooks I will guide you to download and process them. 

## Code

In this notebook you will find all the models previously mentioned.

## Technologies

All the algorithms are written in Python. The hardware of my machine is not powerful so I ran all the models in Google Colab, [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/one-stop-guide-to-google-colab-d67c94d30516) a nice tutorial about how to use it.

## Dependencies 

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Sklearn
* Keras
